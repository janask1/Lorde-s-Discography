# Lorde-s-Discography
This is my final project for my social statistics course where I completed an analysis of Lorde's discography using various statistics. I analyzed the feeling of a song, the release that song is a part of, the age Lorde was when she released the song, the total number of streams, song length, if the song had a music video and if it was a single.

## **Instructions**
To utilize the script, open the "janas.R" file that contains my code for the findings, a the "raw_data - Sheet 1.csv"


## **Data**
The data collected for this analysis was all of Lorde's music releases excluding singles for movies or songs not attached to the original Album or EP. The question being asked was how the emotions of the song can be reflective of how Lorde has aged over the time of her music career, which started at a young and impressionable age. Each unit of analysis is one song and there are 39 obserations.

I gathered the data by listening to the albums/EP in order of realease and following the order of the tracklist. I took note of the release name, song length, age of release, if the song was a single, if there was a music video, the streams a song had and the feeling I associated with that song. 


## **Operationalization**
The concept of emotion was operationalized by picking the common major emotions that the song was conveying and creating a qualitative variable surrounding that. These being: "Upbeat", "Sad", "Content", "Reflective", and "Relaxed". 

The concept of age at release was operationalized by researching the age Lorde was when she released that album or EP and creating a quantitative variable that ranged from 16 to 25.

The concept of streams was operationalized through a quantitative variable counting the total number of streams a song has recieved on Spotify only, ranging from 7,899,507 to 1,210,476,099. 

The concept of whether or not the song had a music video was measured through a binary variable, where "1" represented having a music video, and "0" for songs that did not.

Similar to the music video variable, the concept of whether or not the song was a single was measured through a binary variable, where "1" represented that the song was a single, and "0" represented the song was not a single.

The concept of song length was measured with a quantitative variable counting the total number of seconds long a song was, ranging from 93 to 399.

Lastly, the concept of release name was measured by a qualitative variable tracking the names od the releases I was analyzing, those being "The Love Club EP", "Pure Heroine", "Melodrama", and "Solar Power".
